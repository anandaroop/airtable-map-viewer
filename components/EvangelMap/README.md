# Using the route planning tool

## Pre-preparation

These steps need to be performed beforehand, to get the tool set up for the next round of deliveries

- Change filter on the view **Volunteers: Current Delivery Drivers Map** to match the name of the upcoming delivery, e.g. `Evangel - 2020-07-07`


- Change filter on the view **Delivery Recipients: Map** to match the name of the upcoming delivery, e.g. `Evangel - 2020-07-07`

- Double check that the Map Block in **Maps: Coordinated Deliveries > "Delivery Recipients: Map"** is configured correctly (i.e. pulling from the Map view)

- Double check that the Map Block in **Maps: Coordinated Deliveries > "Volunteers: Current Delivery Drivers Map"** is configured correctly (i.e. pulling from the Current Delivery Drivers Map view)

Sometimes it seems that simply opening the the Map Block configuration is necessary to kick off geocoding of all the recipient records.
