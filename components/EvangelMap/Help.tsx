                This map app provides a friendlier view into the Airtable tables
                we use to manage deliveries.
              </p>
              <p>
                All <em>updates</em> to driving assignments are still made in
                the Airtable interface, but this map interface should make it
                much easier to <em>visualize</em> what drivers are available,
                where they are coming from, which stops are assigned to them,
                which stops still need to be assigned, and so on.
              </p>
              <p>There are basically two different ways to get this done:</p>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  Keep the Airtable{" "}
                  <a
                    target="grid"
                    href="https://airtable.com/tbl8XAiO21AVgeuvw/viwJGcKgSrTDNX6DP"
                  >
                    grid view for this delivery
                  </a>{" "}
                  open in another window and make assignments row-by-row in the{" "}
                  <strong>Driver</strong> column. Refresh this map view
                  frequently, to see the current state of the assignments.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Hover over the map markers to see a link to the associated
                  Airtable record. Click through to open that invidual record
                  and assign a driver. (You'll have to scroll down to the{" "}
                  <strong>Driver</strong> field.) Refresh this map view
                  frequently, to see the current state of the assignments.
                </li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                Open rings represent drivers. Filled discs represent stops.
                Stops will be gray until they are assigned; then they will be
                color-coded to match their driver.
